Gesture Based Volume Control Using Hand Gestures

📌 Project Overview:
This project implements a gesture-based system volume controller using hand gestures captured through a webcam. By measuring the distance between specific hand landmarks, the system dynamically increases or decreases the system volume without any physical contact.

The project uses Computer Vision and Hand Tracking to provide a touch-free and intuitive user experience.

⚙️ TECHNOLOGIES USED:
🐍 Python
📸 OpenCV — for real-time camera access and image processing
✋ MediaPipe — for detecting and tracking hand landmarks 
🔊 PyAutoGUI — for controlling system or media volume

🚀 Features:
✅Real-time hand gesture recognition using a webcam
✅Touchless system volume control
✅Smooth and responsive volume adjustment
✅Interactive UI using Streamlit
✅Visual feedback for hand landmarks and gesture distance

🛠️ Technologies & Libraries Used:
✅OpenCV – Live webcam video capture and frame processing
✅MediaPipe – Hand detection and 21 hand landmark tracking
✅PyAutoGUI – Controlling system volume programmatically
✅Streamlit – Web-based UI for running and visualizing the project
✅NumPy – Numerical computations and distance calculations
✅Plotly – Visualization and interactive graphs

✋ Hand Gesture Logic:
✅MediaPipe detects 21 hand landmarks, including fingertips
✅Distance is calculated between selected landmarks (e.g., thumb tip and index finger tip)
✅Minimum distance: 0
✅Maximum effective distance: 150

🔊Volume Mapping:
✅Increasing the distance between fingers → Volume increases
✅Decreasing the distance between fingers → Volume decreases
✅If the distance exceeds 150 (e.g., 250), the volume remains capped at 100%
✅Volume scales smoothly within the defined distance range

⚙️ Working Principle:
✅Webcam captures live video feed
✅OpenCV processes video frames
✅MediaPipe identifies hand landmarks
✅Distance between landmarks is calculated using NumPy
✅Distance is mapped to system volume level
✅PyAutoGUI adjusts the system volume accordingly
✅Streamlit displays real-time feedback and visualization
